I am Tyler Koistinen.
I am a 4th year Air Force ROTC cadet and I just changed majors to computer science this winter.
While I am now out of practice, in highschool I was on a nationally ranked air rifle marksmanship team.
My interest in programming first really started when I was looking to mod Civilization IV.

Programming Background:
I took one year of basic web design classes in high school.
